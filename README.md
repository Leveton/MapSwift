This is the curriculum for the iOS track for graduates of LaunchCode’s CS50 course at Miami Dade College.

The course consists of 179 slides centering around MapSwift - a location services iOS app that is versioned here. 

Each lesson has its own git branch. Teachers and students can switch branches to see the app come together - from the call to the main function in lesson 0 to the completed app in lesson 8.

As a versioned document, both the app and the lessons will be periodically updated to keep up with the latest devices and operating systems.

you can send me a pull request to fix any issues/ add any features.

## Themes

The course is opinionated. There is less convention in the iOS community than in the Ruby-on-Rails community or the Java community due to Apple’s traditionally closed nature. Also, there wasn’t much enthusiasm for the platform between the 80’s and the launch of The App Store.

The essential concepts that are often confusing to students are given the most weight. 

Table views are the heart of the app because it’s the standard way to navigate on mobile. They also showcase the delegate pattern which separates beginner Apple devs from more competent devs.

The course resembles [Ry’s Objective-C Tutorial](http://rypress.com/tutorials/objective-c/index) in spirit.

## Course Rationale

Reviewing iOS and Objective-C introductory books before teaching the course, I was struck by how shallowness of the material. Essential concepts like reference counting, delegation, and the object lifecycle were glossed over or excluded altogether. We prefer depth to breadth at LaunchCode. MapSwift is missing many cool features but the features that are there are shared across the vast majority of iOS apps. The implementation of these features is both dwelled upon and repeated to stress their importance and facilitate learning.

Depth is also preferred as there are over 3,000 methods and 200 classes available in Cocoa Touch.

There’s also a lack of pedagogical understanding. Programmers write programming books. Often after decades of programming experience. Their day to day conversations are peppered with trade language and over time they begin to see the world through  a that prism. Along the way they forget a non-engineer’s mindset. As a former teacher and someone acutely interested in Apple’s solving of the ‘user experience’ problem, my approach is humanistic - the material is grounded in reality, not abstraction. I do this through metaphors, visuals, and lessons that are hands-on.

LaunchCode does an excellent job fighting the reputation of difficulty that iPhone/iPad development has. There's a Quora post where a respected contributor comments that building an iOS application will probably be “the most difficult thing you will ever do in your life”.

This isn’t a course for people who have never written a working program. CS50 students do problem sets that are more difficult than the average assignments many junior or even senior developers get.

## Prerequisites

All students are graduates of LaunchCode’s CS50 course. They should know C-style control flow, basic data types, stack vs heap, dequeuing, FIFO and LIFO. Procedural programming in C.

For CS50 students struggling with pointers, iOS and this course provide a visual way to see them in action.

## Homework

Due the the brevity of the course, students are given much homework - including small projects - it's the only way for them to begin to grok the huge iOS universe.
